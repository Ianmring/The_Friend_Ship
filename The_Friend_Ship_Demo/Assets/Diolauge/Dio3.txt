Alright. Let’s get drop anchor and see if we can find anybody around here who can help us out.
Right behind ya!
Ababababeh! Hold up a second there, kiddos.
AAAAH! A dolphin-man!
We just got chased by shark-men a second ago...
Yeah, but I didn’t expect to see other types of fish people down here!
Hey, you watch your mouth, ya putz.
I ain’t no fish. I’m mammalian, capiche?
A mailman?
No I mean, I’m warm-blooded.
You poor thing! Do your veins ever got too hot?
What? I- nevermind. Look: My name’s Danny Da Dolphin. What I’m tryin to say is I used to be just like you kids!
Diabetic?
Home-schooled?
Afraid of crossing guards?
No! I mean I used to be human! That was, until I fell through that crack in the ocean and washed up on dry land down here. The second my hand made contact with the beach, I watched turn it into a flipper before my very eyes!
That’s so sad!...
Welp, c’mon, sis.
Let’s get out of the boat and start looking for help.
NO! You dolts! I mean if you get outta that boat, the same thing will happen to you!
Huh?
There’s somethin’ odd about the sand down here. Ain’t like the sand you see on the surface. Not sure how, but it turns everyone who touches it into water-folk, like me.
So, you’re saying we can never leave this boat?
Not unless you wanna spend the rest of your life living off herring and sea urchins.
I love herring!
Oh my god... Look, guys, do whatever ya like, but don’t say I didn’t warn you...
