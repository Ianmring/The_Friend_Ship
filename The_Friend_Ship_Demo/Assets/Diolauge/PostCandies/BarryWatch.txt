Here you are Barry!
One shiny watch!
KIDS! 
Thank you so much!
KIDS!
I thought we had a good thing going!
You give me the watch and I give you money!
Who says no to money?!
Clearly these kids do.
And they have more integrity than you ever will!
Again, I don't know that word. But it sounds good!
Even though the plane doesn't work.
We're still happy to help!
Wait, it doesn't work???
I thought it was still flyable.
Yea, surprising that a plane sitting out there for so long wouldn't work.
Not to me, I knew that piece of junk wouldn't fly.
So you knew it wouldn't fly.
And you were gonna let these kids waste their time with a broken plane.
Hey, I never said it was working or broken.
I just said it was there.
And even if I did, were you going to be the one to tell them?
We were really hoping that would take us home.
well I feel just awful...
Me too kids, but I guess that's life hu?
Danny!
What, i'm just being honest with them! They chose you over me.
I'm a bit heart broken over.
Were sorry Danny
If there were two gold watches, we would have given the other one to you.
Thanks kids, ya broke my heart today not gonna lie, but i'm still a businessman.
So if you got something valuable like..oh..say
A pair of Moon Shoes. 
Then we'll talk then.
Later kids. 
I feel bad about Danny.
Yea, he's so cool...
Maybe we made a mistake bro.
Yea I think we did...
NO, you kids made the right call bringing me this watch.
Trust me, now me and Danny will still have something to remember Papa Pepino.
Even if he doesn't have it, he knows the watch is with me.
And that a piece of pops is still around.

...
Tell you what, I know a guy who can help you find another way out. 
He's a bit...
Eccentric...
But he's well informed on everything that goes down here. 
His name is Carl and one of those paranoid conspiracy theory types that has a bit of information on everything.
If anyone knows a way out, it's him.
Hey I'm named Carl!
He and I are named Buddies!
Sis, let's go meet my name buddy!
Right!
...
How do we get to him?
Easy. There should be a gap just east of my brother's place. 
From there it's a clear route to his place. 
You can't miss it. 
It's a giant Sea Anemone.
Because he's a clown fish.
GREAT!
We'll head out immediately.
Unless the sharks or something else is blocking our way.
Oh yea, I forgot about them.
Wait, you kids are in trouble with the "The Sharks of the Streets"?
Be careful, they've been known to surround their enemies unexpectedly and in large radiuses.
Waiting for them to fall into their traps.  
Oh no!
Were within a large radius!
But you kids seem clever, I know you'll find a way not only to get past them. 
But to get home!
As soon as you leave, I'll radio Carl to let him know your coming.
Sounds good!
Katie, are you ready?
Ready as i'll ever be!
Lets go!
