Here you are Danny! one priceless family heirloom!
AAA KIDS!
I knew you'd make the right call!
I'm so proud of you! 
Wow, Danny's proud of us!
I'm so happy right now!
What are you doing kids?  
Why are you giving a precious family heirloom to someone who obviously doesn't care about family?!
Well, because he's Danny
Yea, he's Danny 
Yea Barry, It's because I'm Danny
I know he's Danny... I just didn't think you'd choose him over me.
I mean, it just seems like such an obvious mistake.
Aww, were sorry Barry.
We still like you.
Yea, I figured.
Your still impressionable kids, you're still learning right from wrong.
I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. 
Well now I feel bad...
No one's ever been disappointed in us.
Yea, maybe we made a mistake...
What? no you kids made the smart decision. 
Barry's fine.
He's just being a dramatic pencil neck.
Trust me, I've done worse
Worse? WORSE? Why don't you tell them you're the reason we're down here!
Danny? it's your fault you got stuck down here?
Kinda, it's a LONG story.
No it's not! 
Kids this is how it happened.
We..
Woah Waoh Woah
I just remembered I'm trying to save on electricity and exposition!
Danny doesn't do it!
aaaa sorry Barry *cresshhhhhh* ya breaking *cresshhhhhh*
Kids come to my Shop...
Later bro!
So! now that the nerd is out of the way. Let's do Business!
Ok danny!
As promised, some cash for your trip back up!
oh wow! Thanks Danny! You're really the best!
Yea! This would have been great if the plane still worked!
what... the plane's not working... i'm so surprised...
I know! And it looked so flyable from the outside!
I guess we're going to be down here for a lot longer than expected.
...Maybe not kids... Maybe not..
You see, there's a Clown Fish that lives south east of me named Carl!
I'm named Carl!
Yea, no kidding. Anyway this guy is one of those wackoss that believes in all kinds of conspiracies.
Like spy roaches, fake moon landings, and holes in the ozone layer. 
He's got a bit of info on everything, true or not.
I'd start there looking for a way out. 
Great! Thanks for the tip! 
Yea! thanks danny!
Anytime kids! It was nothing!
Come by to MY shop anytime you'd like. 
And NOT my brother's
Are you ok danny?
You sounded a bit funny at moments.
I'm a good kid, I've been emphasizing those words so often, for so long, in that order, it's become second nature to me. 
OH that makes sense!
You ready to go bro 
Yea! hopefully the sharks haven't found us!
Wait, you in trouble with "The Sharks of the Streets"?
They're a dangerous bunch, good briber though. 
But I've heard their even better bribies, if you follow me.
Aaaaaa we understand you Danny.
Yea danny, we understand you Danny.
...

...
You kids don't know what I'm talking about do you?
No we don't
Bribe any sharks you see!
Ohhh yea that makes more sense than what we were thinking!
Thanks Danny! We won't forget what you did for us!
Let's go Bro!
