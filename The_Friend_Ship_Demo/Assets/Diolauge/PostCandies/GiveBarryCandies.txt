AAAA
I knew you were good kids!
We are! 
Our parents tell us all the time!
I figure.
Anyhow, as promised
Here's a little something to help you get out of here.
A key to the downed plane that brought me and my brother here. Yours to keep! 
Oh wow! that's perfect!
Thank you Barry!
Anytime kids, at least some of us should make it out of here.
We'll never forget what you've done for us.
We really won't.
We have good memories.
I'm sure you do.
OH, and while you're out there. 
Would it be possible to collect something for me? 
You mean before we leave? Sure
Great!
Inside the plane there should be a golden watch that belonged to my father.
It's the only thing I have to remember him by. And I'd very much like it back.
I'd get it myself, but every time I leave my shop Danny wrecks the place. 
Woah Woah Woah.
First off, I think you mean "cosmetically improve"
And second off, you talking about Papa Pepino's gold watch?
That thing's worth a small fortune.
And you plan on just KEEPING it?
Yes Danny.
Not all of us are motivated by money.
Some of us are intrinsically motivated by good actions. Like these kids over here.
Right Kids?
I'm not sure what intrinsic means, but it sounds really positive. 
So I'm going to agree.
Same here.
Well kids, if you wanna do some good for both me and yourselves.
Bring me the watch and not only will I let you keep the plane.
But I'll give you a little something for your trouble. 
As opposed to "Happy Feelings", which will get you nothing. 
Well, either way. The plane should be north of my shop and west of my brothers. 
Were on it!
Don't worry Danny/Barry, we'll get that watch for you!
