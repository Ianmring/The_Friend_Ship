BR: AAAA
BR: I knew you were good kids!
B: We are! 
G: Our parents tell us all the time!
BR: I figure.
BR: Anyhow, as pormissed
BR: Here's a little something to help you get out of here.
BR: A key to the downed plane that brought me and my brother here. Your's to keep! 
B: oh wow! thats perfect!
G: Thank you Barry!
BR: Anytime kids, a least some of us should make it out of here.
B: We'll never forget what you've done for us.
G: We really won't.
G: We have good memories.
BR: Im sure you do.
BR: OH, and while you're out there. 
BR: Would it be possible to collect something for me. 
B: you mean before we leave? Sure
BR: Great!
BR: Inside the plane there should be a golden watch that belonged to my father.
BR: It's the only thing I have to remember him by. And I'd very much like it back.
BR: I'd get it myself, but every time I leave my shop Danny randsacks the place. 
D: Woah Woah Woah.
D: First off, I think you mean "cosmetically improve"
D: And second off, you talking about Papa Pepino's gold watch?
D: That thing's worth a small fortne.
D: And you plan on just KEEPING it?
BR: Yes Danny.
BR: Not all of us are motivated by money.
BR: Some of us are intrinsically motivated by good actions. Like these kids over here.
BR: Right Kids?
G: Im not sure what intrinsic means, but it sounds really positive. 
G: So I'm going to agree.
B: Same here.
D: Well kids, if you wanna do some good for both me and youselves.
D: Bring me the watch and not only will I let you keep the plane.
D: But I'll give you a little somehting for your trouble. 
D: As opposed to "Happy Feelings", which will get you nothing. 
BR: Well, either way. The plane sould be north of my shop and west of my brothers. 
G: Were on it!
B: Dont worry Danny/Barry, we'll get that watch for you!
