Well I'll be darned, you kids came though.
Good Job Kids!
Wow! Danny just gave us a complement
This is the best moment of my life
Just after seeing that bug on our monthly nature walk!
And before getting that extra chicken nugget at McDaniels.  
errrr right, anyway. 
I'm a man of my word, here ya are! a key to a plane. 
Wow a Plane!
With that, we'll be out of here in no time!
Thanks Danny! we owe you so big time!
You really don't.
Which is why I'm going to call in that implied favor you just gave me.
Of course! anything for you Danny!
Great!
In the Plane, there should be a golden watch. 
This particular watch belonged to my father. 
It's worth a lot to me...
Monetarily speaking of course.D: I'd get it myself, but I can't leave my pawn shop unattended. 
And since this is a pawn shop. I'll set you up with some spending money.
AND, you can keep the plane once you get out of here
Wow! you really are such a great guy!
I'm glad we met such a wonderful Fish-Man!
Nawww kids stop ya making me blush.
And im a mammal by the way
Woah Woah Woah.
You can't seriously be thinking of selling off Papa Pepinos golden watch!
It's the only thing we have to remember him by!
Cram it Big Mouth!
That thing's worth a lot of money!
And I don't see you goin over there and getting it!
Well I would, if you didn't toss all of my product on the floor every time I leave.
Listen kids, if you have any common sense. 
DO NOT! give that watch to him!
Please, if you find the watch. Give it to me.
It's the only thing we have of him.
Barry, these are clearly smart kids. 
They'll make the right call
Yea, we are smart kids!
Thought so.
The plane should be just west of here and North of my Brother's
Don't worry Danny and Barry.
We'll find the watch and give it to its rightful owner.
