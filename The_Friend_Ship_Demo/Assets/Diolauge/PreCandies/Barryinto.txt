Maybe there's someone here that can help us.
Why does it smell so sad here?
That, my friend, is the smell of fluorescent lighting and minimum wage graveyard shifts!
You heard that voice too, right?
Welcome to See-N-Leave! I'm Barry. 
How can I help you today?
Look! A screamy whale!
Uhh, I'm a basking shark actually.
Asking sharks what?
Basking Shark.
You're asking sharks "basking shark"?
Uhhhh... Sure, yeah. 
Yeah, that's what I'm doing. 
ANYWAY, what can I do for you kids today?
Well, we kinda just wanted to ask a few questions if you don't mind.
Yeah.
First and foremost: How are you today?
I'm terrific, sir, and yourself?
Great! Thanks for asking!... 
Wait...
I mean kinda bad actually! 
We're lost and separated from our parents.
Yeah, do you know how we can get back home?
You mean to the surface world?
I have a few ideas on how to do that...
Oh, good! What should we do?
Ditch this pencil-neck and come see me, that's what you should do.
Did your desk just talk?
Ugh... Don't mind him. 
That's just my brother, Danny. 
Your brother is a desk?
Yikes. Some real special little angels ya got there, huh Barry?
Listen, kids, you can stick with my duddly-do-right brother here and take him up on his little to worthless advice.
Or you can come visit me at my... "base of operations." 
Where for the right price, I can get you back with no hassle. 
Don't listen to him, whatever he's offering is a load of Cr...
What do you mean price?
Well, what do you have on you?
Well not much, just some camping stuff. OH and some trail mix with little candies.
BINGO! KID!
I haven't had candy since before I got down here! 
Bring me the Candies separated from the trail mix and I'll set you up and more!
See ya real soon kids.
Don't listen to him, the second he can. He'll double cross you. 
Tell you what, to spite my brother and protect you kids.
If you give me the candy. Not only will I answer any questions you have, I'll help you get outta here as well! What do you say!
Mmmm, we have a lot to think about don't we sis.
Yea, this is going to be a tough decision on who to trust.
