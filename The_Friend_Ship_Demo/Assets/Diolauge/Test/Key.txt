Open it up sis!
Ok!
*Katie opens plane door opens and they get in*
Gee, this plane sure is dirty
But I think I should still fly.
Let's test it to see if it will turn on. 
Wait, do you know how to fly a plane?
No
But we can figure it out as we go
Sounds Good!
*Carl starts plane but it doesn't turn on*
Oh no, I don't think this plane will turn on
That's not good.
I guess we'll be down here for longer than expected
Yea..
Let's search the plane for the watch.
Sounds good
*they search the plane and find a lock box and a heavy bucket of gold paint*
Well sis, it looks like we found a lock box and a bucket of gold paint
mmmmm
Maybe the watch is inside the lock box!
Yea! It probably is
But how are we gonna get it open?
