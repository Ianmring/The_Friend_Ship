B: Open it up sis!
G: ok
*Katie opens plane door opens and they get in*
G: gee, this plane sure is dirty
G: But I think I should still fly.
B: Let's test it to see if it will turn on. 
G: Wait, do you know how to fly a plane?
B: No
B: But we can figure it out as we go
G: Sounds Good!
*Carl starts plane but it doesn't turn on*
G: oh no, I don't think this plane will turn on
B: That's not good.
B: I guess we'll be down here for longer than expected
G: Yea..
B: Let's search the plane for the watch.
G: Sounds good
*they search the plane and find a lock box and a heavy bucket of gold paint*
B: Well sis, it looks like we found a lock box and a bucket of gold paint
G: mmmmm
G: Maybe the watch is inside the lock box!
B: Yea! It probably is
B: But how are we gonna get it open?
