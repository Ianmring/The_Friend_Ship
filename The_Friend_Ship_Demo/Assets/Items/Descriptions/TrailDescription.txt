 A little plastic baggie full of "Prospector Suggins’ Hearty Trail Mix"-brand trail mix. Filled with peanuts, almonds, raisins, those weird yellow raisin-looking things that are in trail mix sometimes, and most importantly chocolate candies. Mom poured it into a separate bag because the old gold prospector man on the packaging scares us.
